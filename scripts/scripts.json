None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.\n\n\nAttila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.\n\n\nBut the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.\n\n\nStanding before Attila, the old man calmly said, \"Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.\"\n\n\nCurious, Attila did as he asked.\n\n\nThen the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.\n\n\n\"Now hold these in both hands,\" he instructed.\n\n\nAttila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.\n\n\nTo an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,\n\n\n\"Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.\".",

      "script": "A man is walking the Las Vegas strip, and runs into the most beautiful women he has ever met. [NSFW]. He starts talking to her, and to his luck he finds out she is a prostitute. So, he asks her.\n\n\"How much for a hand-job?\"\n\n\"5,000$\" she replies.\n\n\"5,000$?? You must be nuts, no way.\" \n\n\"Walk with me.\" She replies. He agrees and they walk for a moment to end up in front of a restaurant. \"You see this restaurant? I own this restaurant because men pay me 5,000$ for hand jobs.\"\n\nHe ponders for a moment. \"Damn, they must be pretty good then. Alright.\" He brings her back to his hotel room. Gets the hand job, and as advertised; it is the best hand job he has ever had. After he finishes, he realizes how perfect she is and asks. \"Okay, that was awesome. How much for a blow job?\"\n\n\"15,000$\" she replies.\n\n\"15,000$?!? You are out of your mind. No way!\" He shouts\n\n\"Come to the window.\" They walk to the window and she begins to point. \"You see those three casinos? I own those casinos because men pay me 15,000$ for blow jobs.\"\n\n\"Fine, how can i say no?\"\n\nOnce again, it is the best blow job of his life. He is writhing in ecstasy after finishing, and practically in love with this woman. \"Okay, I am gonna regret this. How much for the pussy?\"\n\n\"Come to the window.\" He follows her to the window, ready for anything. \"Do you see all of Las Vegas?\" She asks.\n\n\"No way! You own all of Las Vegas?!\" He exclaims, astounded.\n\n\"No..\" she looks down. \" But I would if I had a pussy...\".",
