The man says \"Aren't you the guy who charges 10k a bullet?\" The hitman replies \"Yeah, thats me.\" The man says \"I have a job for you. I got 20k spare, and I found out my wife was cheating on me with my best friend. I want you to shoot my wife in the head, and my friend in the penis.\" The hitman accepts the offer, and the man gives him the name of the hotel they are staying at.\n\nThey both arrive at the hotel, and climb to the roof of a building next to it. The hitman aims at the window of the wife's hotel room. The man says to the hitman \"Why are you taking so long? Go ahead and take the shot!\" The hitman says, \"Be patient. I'm trying to save you $10,000.\".",
