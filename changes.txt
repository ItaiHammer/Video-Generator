# Updated Project Changes 31/08/2021


# New Reliable Chromedriver Used
# A more reliable chromedriver executable is used from repository: https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver
# Hopefully this will lower error rates from tiktok detecting this bot using various javascript libraries.

# Useragent Randomisation
# Instead of using "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.169 Safari/537.36",
# We will use the repository: https://github.com/hellysmile/fake-useragent, for a random useragent every login.

# Abstraction in Bot.py.
# Many click javascript functions were repetitive and made for very confusing code, I also code less prone to errors due
# to Javascript by handling Javascript Errors from selenium.

# Fixes in Browser and Bot.py
# Some functions were not needed and confused code in both these files, and so has been changed.

# Cookies Issues Fixed
# Google has a policy not allowing "sameSite" property to be allocated to None and so yields an error, this has been fixed.


# Notes
# All tiktok logins works as normal!

# I'm currently working on scheduling tiktok videos, so videos can be scheduled for any date in the future.

# There are some versions conflicts in requirements.txt, I will fix asap.

# Please update undetected chrome driver package using pip git+git:// instead of the pypi package.
