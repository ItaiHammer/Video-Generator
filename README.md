# the best way to upload:
Make sure that you post at max 3-4 videos a day, each 3-4 hours apart so that they don't think you are a bot.
Make sure that there are only 6 hashtags per video so you won't confuse the algorithm and that they are always the same to the niche.
All videos should be over a minute to be monetized.
Brighter videos tend to get more views.
Never delete or private a video, it messes with the algorithm, instead keep uploading vids.
